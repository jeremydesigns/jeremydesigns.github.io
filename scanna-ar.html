							<p><b> Role: </b> UX designer	/ Unity AR Developer </p>

							<p> <b> Skills: </b> Unity, Figma, ARFoundation </p>

							<p> <b> Platform: </b> PC / iOS </p>

									<h4> Overview </h4>
									<p> At Patio Interactive Inc., we recorded several audio recordings on cannabis products that we wanted to use as part of a catalogue that can be scanned.
										Initially we had wanted the experience to work as an e-commerce product combined with an AR experience but as part of R&D,
										we developed both products separately anyways. A markerless AR app was developed and designed that simulated a real life budtender to provide users with the ability to find information and details about cannabis products. </li>

									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="breakdown-column" style="width: 50% !important; text-align: left;">
									<h4> What I Did: </h4>
									<ul>
											<li> Added the features for the AR budtender: navigation for product information and video clips explaining features of the product </li>
											<li>Added a 3D environment for individual Cannabis products explaining product information in an intuitive and easy way.</li>
											<li>Added scanning features where scanning specific products enables a markerless AR experience.</li>
											<li>Learned and shot video demos of Scanna and cut together clips and audio to make a pitch video that was used during pitches by sales.</li>

									</ul>

							<h4> Research and Development</h4>
							<p>To start the development of this project, first I would look into the possible technologies available that would that let me decide how I want to design it. With a good understanding of what I can do, I can best optimize the experience via the design. </p>
							<p>As such, the two technologies that I looked into were ARFoundation, Unity’s built-in AR solution, and Vuforia, an external framework known for its AR capabilities. While both solutions work great, I decided to go with ARFoundation because upon building some early prototypes, both solutions have excellent image tracking (which would allow me to scan products) and plane detection, but ARFoundation does not feature a watermark which makes the experience more pleasant to view.</p>
							<p> Part of the research for this project also included the incorporation of Unity and Android. Although no progress was made with cataloging the existing database of cannabis product to Unity, a scaled down version in Unity was instead explored. </p>
							<br>

							<h4> Design + Lo-fi Mockup</h4>
							<p> With technology settled, I would turn my attention to the design. While not many similar apps exist, I would take a look at many e-commerce platforms and minimalistic AR experiences and apply some of their features to Scanna.</p>

							<br>
							<br>
							<p>
								After scanning a cannabis product, a brief loading screen will appear indicating that the scan is successful. Once the scan completes the user will be taken to the product’s description page showing all features of that product and where the user can purchase and learn more about it.
							</p>

							<br>


							<img src="img/scanna/4.png">
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>

							<p> Product page features many features as seen on a product of an online store. Page features brand of product, name, description, THC & CBD information, providers, similar products, and a clickable AR feature as a FAQ. The AR feature spawns a hologram budtender that educate users on the specific product and let’s the user view the product simulated in 3D on their own table. </p>

							<br>
							<br>
							<img src="img/scanna/5.png">
							<br>
							<br>
							<p> When users successfully spawn the budtender for the first time, the app will display specials instructions in which the user can interact with the bud by zooming in/out, rotating, or scaling the bud to view better.</p>


							<br>
							<img src="img/scanna/6.png">
							<br>
							<br>
							<br>
							<p> Details included when spawning the hologram budtender includes recorded audio of the different moods, flavours, and best uses for the specific product. Information via the product page are also viewable within the budtender view.</p>
							<p>If users want to look at another product, they can select the reset scan option which will return back to the scan QR phase and allow the user to scan a new product. For users interested in learning more about purchasing, the user can select one of the interactable 3D buttons beside the budtender that will redirect them to a provider.</p>

						





							<!-- <br>
							<h4> reflections</h4>
							<p> Overall, I was quite happy with how the product came out but I wished I had more time to further work on the UI/UX. With emphasis on development as well, it is not easy balancing both roles but being in the position to be both designer and developer, it is easier
							to get my ideas across </p> -->
